# AdrijTC

AdrijTC is a Golang application that simplifies project creation. With this tool, users can enter project details such as project name, programming language, destination directory, and desired templates via a console application. The application then copies the selected templates and combines them into a project, saving time and eliminating the need to rewrite certain elements repeatedly.

## Installation

1. **Install Golang 1.22**: Follow the instructions to install Golang version 1.22 on your system.

2. **Build or Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory of the Go project.
   - To compile the application into an executable (.exe), run:
     ```
     go build main.go
     ```
   - To run the application directly without compiling, use:
     ```
     go run main.go
     ```
   - Further instructions will be provided in the console application.

## Todos

- Add support for additional programming languages and templates.
